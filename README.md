## DONE

-   Figure a way out for dynamic table generation for editing units
    -   Tag system; every stat is now a tag, to edit a monster's stat select the appropriate tag and monsters with selected tags will show.
    -   Create a monster; user is now able to create a new monster with the existing tags.
